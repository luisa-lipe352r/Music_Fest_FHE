# FHE-based Music Festival Simulation Game

Dive into the rhythm of the **FHE-based Music Festival Simulation Game**! This innovative game empowers players to step into the shoes of a music festival organizer, leveraging **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology** to securely evaluate potential band popularity while planning the festival. Whether you strategize contract signings with FHE-encrypted bands or navigate the complexities of venue design and marketing, this unique simulation challenges your insight and management skills in the cultural industry.

## Problem Statement

In today's digital landscape, the entertainment industry grapples with significant challenges—how to evaluate the potential of different music acts and how to ensure financial success without compromising sensitive data. As a festival organizer, understanding the market's reception to various bands and making informed decisions about contracts and promotions can be daunting. Traditional methods often fail to protect sensitive data, leading to privacy concerns and loss of competitive edge.

## The FHE Solution

Our game addresses these challenges head-on by implementing **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**, which allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without revealing the data itself. Using **Zama's open-source libraries** such as **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**, the game seamlessly evaluates the encrypted potential popularity of different bands and synthesizes market responses. This ensures that player decisions are both informed and secure, paving the way for a new level of strategy in the simulation gaming genre.

## Core Features

🎶 **Encrypted Band Potential**: Securely evaluate bands based on their FHE-encrypted potential without compromise.

📈 **Market Response Calculation**: Utilize homomorphic encryption for accurate assessments of audience demand and market fluctuations.

🏟️ **Festival Planning Interface**: Design your festival venue and manage contracts, ensuring an immersive experience that tests your strategic thinking and operational skills.

⚡ **Simulated Cultural Dynamics**: Experience the unpredictable nature of the cultural industry, where your decisions impact the festival's success.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama SDK**: Specifically, leverage Zama's **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs** for confidential computing.
- **Node.js**: For backend functionality.
